# Face recognition in a database

This project is in collaboration with [exoMakina](http://www.exomakina.fr/eXo_maKina/eXo_maKina.html). We are trying to improve face recognition on a database of pictures of public personas. We will build on top 
the face recognition technology provided by [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition).

## NOTE : 

To use the annotations results, please first run "traitement resultats.py".
It will prevent various issues linked to absolute path and differences in OS.
It generates a file called "local_results.pkl", which you can use to run 
supervised learning algorithms.
